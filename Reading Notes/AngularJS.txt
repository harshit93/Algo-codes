For AngularJS, the directives control the behaviour of the elements
Modules: Modularizes the code, and here we define all the dependencies
Directive: ng-app: Goes with the <html> tag, and runs the module written with it (the name), when the documant loads
Expressions: Way of inserting dynamic values into HTML
Controllers: We define behaviour and values here
