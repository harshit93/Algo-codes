In order to solve a problem by recursion, keep in mind that:
1. It should have subproblems
2. There should be a base condition on which it terminates
3. The sub problem to be solved should be same as the parent problem, but of a smaller magnitude.
4. There should be no cycles (We should not reach a state we started off from)
